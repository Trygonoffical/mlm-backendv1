But here's the thing&mdash;getting in even a short workout can make a world of difference. You don&rsquo;t need to spend hours at the gym to see results. Even 20 minutes of movement a day can boost your energy, improve your mood, and set the tone for a healthier lifestyle.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">Pro Tip</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">: Try breaking your workouts into smaller chunks.

It&rsquo;s all about consistency over perfection.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal; mso-outline-level: 3;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">2.

We totally get it&mdash;when you&rsquo;re drained, exercising feels like the last thing on your mind. But here&rsquo;s a little secret: exercise actually gives you more energy! Sounds counterintuitive, but moving your body can help boost your circulation, get your heart pumping, and leave you feeling more awake and alert.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">Pro Tip</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">: Start with something gentle&mdash;like a walk or some light yoga.
